Steeped in the ancient traditions of a distant home world orbiting a dying star, kasathas are
four-armed humanoids who arrived in the Pact Worlds aboard a massive worldship named Idari.
Striving for cosmic balance in all things, kasathas take pride in tempering their technological
advances with the wisdom of their ancestors.

Kasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world
orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as
the Gap, kasatha leaders realized their planet was dying and made a plan to leave
Kasath and settle on the distant red world in the Golarion system known as Akiton.
Centuries later, they arrived in the Pact Worlds system aboard the worldship Idari,
only to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most
kasathas decided to stay onboard the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to
the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical
knowledge is a welcomed addition to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas
are found throughout the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.
If you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should
play a kasatha.

YOU MIGHT...
• Seek to maintain balance and harmony between
yourself and others, as well as among cosmic forces.
• Find traditional weaponry to be more honorable than
modern munitions.
• Keep your mouth hidden with a scarf or mask while
in public.

OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume your respect for tradition gives you an
inflexible view of the universe.
• Go to you for advice and expect you to provide
guidance and wisdom.
• Take your prioritization of personal dignity as a sign
of elitism.


PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Kasathas are humanoids with gray skin, four arms, and
pure black eyes. They have an elongated skull that extends
behind their neck, further accentuating their tall frames. After
evolving to survive migrations on a massive world, many
kasathas have wiry bodies with thick musculature that makes
them strong despite their lanky appearance.
Kasathas reach adulthood around the age of 25 and
typically live for 100 to 140 years. Kasathas of mixed
ancestry tend to come from families who left Idari during the
species’ initial wave of emigration; these kasathas often use
their Tempering to seek out elders who can teach them more
about their traditions. Many kasathan familial communities
appreciate the unique perspective these individuals can
provide as kasathas learn to adapt to new homes and
environments.

SOCIETY
Kasathan culture prioritizes stability and balance, with a
respect for honor, tradition, and the importance of upholding
and respecting one’s edicts and anathema. Most kasathas
form matriarchal and nomadic clans and subclans organized
into a complex myriad of “Great Families.” While each Great
Family has its own set of customs and traditions, common
staples include concealing one’s mouth from all but your
most intimate companions, a belief in the honor of fighting
with melee weapons, and a coming-of-age period known as
the Tempering, a year-long journey in which a kasatha is
encouraged to test their limits, learn from different cultures,
and forgo familial customs in the hopes of learning firsthand
the importance of stability and tradition.
In the ancient past, kasathas developed a shared
language that had hundreds of dialects and sublanguages
derived from Kasath’s ancient nations and powerful Great
Families. Dozens more dialects originated on the Idari
during its long journey across the galaxy, usually derived
from sectors, neighborhoods, and vocations. Thanks to
their longstanding respect for tradition and reverence of
history, many of these dialects live on and are still spoken
in the Pact Worlds to this day. While most kasathas go by
their first name, many have a full name consisting of up to
half a dozen elements referring to one’s ancestors, clan, and
connection to the Great Families of Kasath. For example, a
kasatha properly named “Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan
Allar and House Holdare, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts”
would likely introduce themself as Barasul.
Sample Names: Altronus, Barasul, Ehu, Esar, Gorsen, Hadif,
Jahir, Kala, Khsutil, Maeda, Metweska, Ninura, Remu, Senesel,
Tolar, Umana, Voloteo, Zye

BELIEFS
Kasathan cultures hold custom and ancestral tradition in
high regard, but each kasatha follows their own unique set
of traditions, combining the rituals of their clan with those
they develop through life experience. This accumulation of
traditions and customs often inspires older kasathas to spend
time remembering and honoring the past daily.
Popular Edicts maintain balance, honor your traditions,
establish your own customs, cover your mouth in public
Popular Anathema disrespect or belittle the traditions of
others, disrespect your elders

KASATHA HERITAGES
A kasatha’s heritage might be influenced by the environs their
ancestors inhabited on Kasath, the lineage they were born into,
or their progenitors’ role in their peoples’ interstellar migration.
Choose one of the following kasatha heritages at 1st level.

AKITONIAN
You (or one of your ancestors) traveled to the Pact Worlds on
the Idari and settled on Akiton. Akiton’s significantly lower
gravity grants you an advantage in the fun and practical art of
leaping, and you likely revel in the many rituals surrounding
the desert world’s popular sports. You gain the Quick Jump
feat and don’t treat sand as uneven ground.

KASATH SURVIVALIST
You and your ancestors were among those who chose not to
abandon your dying homeworld. Your people trek through
wasted lands under dim skies, seeking shelter and resources
even as they slowly dwindle. You may have finally decided to
seek a better life, or perhaps you hope to convince others to
return to Kasath with you. You can Hustle twice as long while
exploring before you have to stop. If you’re in a group that is
Hustling, you increase the total number of minutes the group
can Hustle by 10 minutes, or by 20 minutes if you’re 13th level
or higher. You gain the Feather Step feat.

SHIPBORN
You were one of the kasathas born and raised on the Idari
generation ship that now orbits the Pact Worlds’ sun. Your
family kept hope and tradition alive while enduring the
hardships of lengthy space travel. For you, the Idari is the
only home you’ve ever known. When you roll a success on
a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical
success instead.

STELLAR NOMAD
You choose to travel abroad, leaving your birthplace to embark
on a journey through the wider cosmos. During your daily
preparations, you can study a particular faction, philosophy,
ancestry, or religion to learn one of their edicts or anathemas
and gain a broader understanding of that culture’s customs
and traditions. While you follow that edict or anathema, you
become trained in the associated lore (such as Vesk Lore or
Damoritosh Lore). This proficiency lasts until you prepare
again. Since this training is temporary, you can’t use it as a
prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a
skill increase.

TEMPERING
You are undergoing your Tempering, a coming-of-age ritual in
which a kasatha rejects the formal traditions of their family
and experiences other customs and traditions. You may be
one of the Untempered, a kasatha who chooses to continue
their Tempering beyond the traditional yearlong period. You
become trained in Society and gain the Streetwise feat.
