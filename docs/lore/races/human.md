Humans are known for their ability to adapt and thrive in the most rigorous situations, including the
mysterious loss of their homeworld, Golarion. Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans
maintain a robust presence in the galaxy, often taking on positions of leadership or acting at the
forefront of exploration. Today, humans can be found almost anywhere, doing almost anything.

Human ambition has created empires throughout the stars. The Pact Worlds
have a strong human presence, and the expansion of the Azlanti Star
Empire is a more sinister expression of humanity’s potential. Though the Azlanti
Star Empire is considered a bastion of oppression, there are countless diverse and
inclusive societies established by humanity across the galaxy, and humans played
a role in founding the most famous port in the known cosmos: Absalom Station.
Regardless of their motives, humans thrive in both urban sprawls and in the most
remote galactic frontiers.
If you want an adaptable character who can be just about anything, you should
play a human.

YOU MIGHT...
• Strive to achieve greatness, either for personal gain or
on behalf of a cause.

• Cherish your relationships with family and friends.

OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Respect your flexibility and usual open-mindedness.

power or wealth.

to assume your intentions.

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Humans’ physical characteristics vary based on their lineage and homeworld.
Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features.
Some environments produce distinct human appearances, such as crimson-skinned
hylki humans living on Akiton.
Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity
occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old.


SOCIETY
Human societies are as varied as the worlds they thrive on. While the Azlanti Star
Empire seeks to recapture an imagined era of glory by isolating and idealizing an
ancient culture from lost Golarion, most human groups coexist with other
species in diverse communities. These vast cultural differences can be both
fascinating and frustrating to other ancestries. Human settlements just a few
miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores.
Furthermore, human societies are always in flux—constantly
adapting to new ideas, discoveries, and technologies. Despite
their diverse lifestyles and outlooks, humans are adaptive
and ambitious—traits which have driven them to explore the
unknown, forge their own futures, and settle on countless
planets, creating lives for themselves by either integrating
into alien societies or creating communities and settlements
on distant worlds.
Of all the common ancestries in the Pact Worlds, humans
were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion’s
disappearance, humans were left with relatively little
evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their
society. While Absalom Station and other worlds with large
human populations contain documents related to the ancient
history of humanity, how much relevance this should have
to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some,
these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their
origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to
ancient factions forward into the modern era. To some, this
approach is seen as counterintuitive.
Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally follow
ancient traditions and shared histories, humanity’s diversity
has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of
Absalom Station have different names than those dwelling
on Akiton or Verces. Humans throughout much of the galaxy
speak Common, which is believed to be a language originally
spoken on Golarion, yet their names are as varied as their
beliefs and appearances.
Sample Names: Akif, Alezandaru, Amare, Baolo, Belor,
Darilian, Hadzi, Hai Minh, Hiriko, Iolana, Jokug, Korva,
Morvius, Navasi, Pao, Pasara, Raziya, Revhi, Sahba, Seoni,
Sephia, Signe, Valeros, Valki, Yon, and Zemir

BELIEFS
Humans often believe in the structures they’ve established,
and many adhere to the ideals of the Pact or follow the
laws of other regions or organizations, like the Azlanti Star
Empire or the Free Captains. Many also cleave tightly to
faith, philosophy, or religion, finding in these intellectual and
spiritual touchstones confidence, clarity, and comfort. Since
humanity eagerly embraces change, there are always humans
who oppose societal norms by challenging longstanding
beliefs or laws. These ideals, whether societal, intellectual, or
spiritual, are often used as a driving force or justification for a
human’s behavior and ambitions.

HUMAN HERITAGES


AZLANTI
You or your ancestors were born on a world controlled by the
Azlanti Star Empire. You may have prominent brows, purple
eyes, or a widow’s peak. Choose one cantrip from the arcane
spell list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell at
will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your
level rounded up. You can change this cantrip to a different
one from the same list once per day by meditating to draw on
the power of your runic blood; this is a 10-minute activity that
has the concentrate trait.


GOLARION SURVIVOR
Your ancestors lived on lost Golarion, and though the
circumstances of your family’s survival are lost to the Gap,
your family taught you ancient traditions from a young age.
You become trained with archaic weapons and Golarion Lore,
and you learn a bonus language that was spoken in your
lineage’s region of origin (see Pathfinder Player Core 34). You
gain the Diehard feat.


SCAVENGER
Your ancestors spent generations scraping by on a world ill-
suited to supporting them, such as the dying planet of Akiton,
in the access corridors of Absalom Station’s Downlow, or the
Halls of the Living on Eox, and you’re accustomed to getting
by with less. The number of days you can go without food
or water before you take damage from thirst or starvation
is increased by 2 (to a number of days equal to 3 + your
Constitution modifier). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on
Society and Survival checks to Subsist, and a +1 circumstance
bonus on saving throws against gaining the sickened condition
and to remove the sickened condition.


SKILLED HUMAN
Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills.
You become trained in one skill of your choice. At 5th level,
you become an expert in the chosen skill.


URBANITE
You’ve grown up in a big city and are accustomed to the press
and pull of the largest crowds, the electric buzz and tangle
of streets, or the dense nature of vertical living on a station
or megaplex. You ignore difficult terrain from crowds and
lesser cover from crowds. You become trained in Lore for one
specific city of your choice.
VERSATILE HUMAN
Humanity’s versatility and ambition helped them become
the most common ancestry on Golarion before that world
disappeared. Select a general feat of your choice for which
you meet the prerequisites (as with your ancestry feat, you
can select this general feat at any point during character
creation).
