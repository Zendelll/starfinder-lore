Once known as ratfolk, ysoki are clever and flexible. With roots on countless worlds, ysoki work
alongside larger species helping to establish communities and accomplish tough tasks. From the
largest of crowds to the tightest of tunnels, a ysoki always knows how to find their way. Only
the foolish overlook the presence of a ysoki in a group!


Ysoki populations thrived on Akiton, lost Golarion, and several other worlds
for millennia before spaceflight accelerated cultural exchange in the Pact
Worlds system. The question of whether these ethnicities share common ancestors or
were examples of convergent evolution isn’t important to most ysoki. Often gregarious,
ysoki embrace far-flung “cousins” regardless of differences in appearance and heredity.
Most ysoki love technology and travel, even gravitating toward professions
that others find unpleasant. Ysoki often work as
junkers, long-haul starship crew members,
or mechanics squeezing through cramped
station corridors, so sure of their own
worth that living and working in subpar
conditions is often a source of pride
rather than shame. If you want a character
who is adventurous, confident, and curious,
try playing a ysoki!

YOU MIGHT...
• Keep in touch with a large extended family
scattered throughout the stars, with a cousin to
visit in every port.
• Collect gadgets encountered in your travels and
tinker with everything, even your own cybernetic
augmentations.
• Adopt your coworkers and friends into a found
family.

OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you’re disorganized and messy until they
learn your habits.
• Value your skills with technology but wish you
reassembled things as often as you took them apart.
• Depend on you to stick up for others and always get
the job done.

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Ysoki have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails,
with red or black eyes and fur colors typically in shades
of black, brown, gray, and white. Ysoki appearances vary
considerably, even within a family unit. Many ysoki have
evolved prehensile tails that help them keep their balance
and maneuver in zero gravity, as well as keen noses that can
identify complex chemicals by smell.
Ysoki instinctually maintain cleanliness through personal
grooming and reinforce these habits throughout their strong
social structures. Many ysoki use cosmetics to spice up their
looks and favor cybernetic augmentations, often installed at
a cousin’s bustling street clinic. Ysoki enjoy expressing their
personality through fashion, often layering clothing items
and accessories into a jumbled fusion. Regardless of attire
or profession, ysoki value preparedness and ingenuity, rarely
leaving home without a few useful tools and supplies stuffed
into a backpack, purse, toolbelt, or cheek pouch.

SOCIETY
Ysoki culture values life over credits, framing work as another
communal activity to enjoy. Ysoki communities are tight-knit
and welcoming, always eager to share a meal or swap spare
parts with strangers who don’t look down on them. Many ysoki
adults enjoy distance correspondences with dozens of friends
and relatives, reuniting for warren-wide celebrations whenever
circumstance brings them back together. Others never leave
their homes, serving as pillars of the community and curating
collections of useful junk for generations of grandchildren.
When ysoki aren’t exploring or tinkering, they enjoy time
in communal warrens planet side or nestled into maintenance
tunnels, access corridors, and other spaces often overlooked
by larger folk. Ysoki warrens are cluttered with hoarded
gadgets and boisterous family members. Hoards full of spare
parts and half-finished projects are kept fastidiously clean,
and shared living spaces are typically cramped but tidy—
though the controlled chaos of a ysoki family’s collection
might seem like a mess to outsiders.
Nicknames are often as important to ysoki as their given
names, and they enjoy giving their friends and family
monikers based on their appearance or personality, such as
“Snack,” “Dot,” “Sparks,” or “Boom-Boom.” Many ysoki family
names incorporate their ships or home settlements.
Sample Names: Bena, Coponisa, Cors, Datch, Fitch, Goba,
Kib, Lolo, Niknak, Quig, Resk, Sim, and Twik

BELIEFS
Ysoki care more about their family than abstract moral
concepts, and most ysoki follow their warren’s strict social
codes even if they flout civil laws. Community is important
to ysoki, and they’re likely to respect other cultures’ social
expectations even when they don’t agree.
Ysoki enjoy cultural exchange and acknowledge deities
worshipped in their local settlements, but most never
lose touch with two cultural touchstones: revering their
ancestors and the goddess Lao Shu Po. Lao Shu Po remains
important to ysoki culture throughout the stars, with
every diasporic ysoki population venerating some version
of Grandmother Rat. Lao Shu Po encourages followers to
be selfish, engage in trickery, and embodies values most
ysoki find indecent, though even upstanding ysoki agree
that sometimes these traits are necessary for survival. For
more information about the ysoki goddess Lao Shu Po, see
page 246.

YSOKI HERITAGES
Ysoki adapt to almost any environment and thrive on
countless worlds, ships, and stations throughout the galaxy.
Some ysoki have roots on different worlds, or live entirely
onboard generation ships that ply the stars. Choose one of
the following ysoki heritages at 1st level.

AKITONIAN YSOKI
You or your ancestors were born on Akiton, where you
grew up scrapping crashed starships or combing junk heaps
for treasures. You can gain the trained proficiency rank in
Crafting and can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a
Device. If you’re already trained in Crafting, you instead gain
the Quick Repair general feat.

DEEP YSOKI
You’re accustomed to living in dark places, such as
maintenance corridors, subterranean warrens, asteroids,
and on distant moons and planetoids far from the sun. You
gain darkvision.

LONGSNOUT YSOKI
The long snouts that run in your family give you a keener
sense of smell than most ysoki. You gain imprecise scent with
a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell
to determine a creature’s location. The GM will usually double
the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the
range if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks to Seek a creature or object within the
range of your scent.

SHIPBORN YSOKI
You were born aboard a starship, inside a space station’s access
corridors, or another similar environment. You gain the trained
proficiency rank in Piloting. If you would automatically become
trained in Piloting (from your background or class, for example),
you become trained in another skill of your choice. If you get a
success on a Piloting check to Navigate or Plot Course, you get
a critical success instead.
You adapted to maneuvering in close quarters. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Tumble Through
the spaces of Medium or larger enemies, and the presence of
an enemy doesn’t make the squares difficult terrain.

TUNNEL YSOKI
Your incredibly small bones allow you to easily compress
your body and squeeze through gaps, whether it’s the space
between walls to reach a severed data cable or the ductwork
of a space station. You gain the Quick Squeeze feat, even if
you aren’t trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough
to require the Squeeze action aren’t difficult terrain for you.
