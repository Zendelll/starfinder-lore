Prismenis are suffused with the energy of the Drift, a recently discovered hyperspace plane,
and are spiritual kin to the spectra who call that plane home. Wherever they go and whatever
they do, they carry a fragment of the Drift inside them, and they can access that plane and its
power through this internal connection.

Prismenis are inherently “plugged in” to the Drift,
but the origins of this connection are variable. Most
prismenis were born prismenis—some to parents who were
particularly devout followers of Triune and some to non-
worshippers who happened to be in the Drift when their
child was born, hatched, gestating, or conceived. Yet, not all
children born in the Drift become prismenis, just as not all
those born to pious Triunites become prismenis. Most believe
that their lineage is a direct result of Triune’s blessing,
while others believe it comes down to luck, genetics, or a
quantifiable scientific factor that’s yet to be identified.
Some prismenis aren’t born but transformed, becoming
prismenis only after prolonged close contact with a spectra,
being present at a spectra gathering, or after performing
a dangerous task on behalf of Triune. In these instances,
becoming a prismeni is considered a blessing, granted by
Triune to its chosen children. During the recent Drift Crisis,
a year-long event that saw the Drift crash and slowly reboot
back to functionality, prismenis were born and transformed
with incredible frequency, increasing their population and
incidentally giving prismenis greater influence on the galactic
stage than ever before.

Like the Drift itself, prismenis are always in motion. They
dislike idleness and monotony and sometimes go out of their
way to break routines, traditions, and expectations simply
for the excitement of trying something new. This refusal
to settle is often literal, with prismenis changing jobs and
homes frequently, or drifting in and out of relationships with
abandon, but it’s just as often immaterial, with prismenis
embracing innovation, experimentation, education, or new
fads and trends. Prismenis like to travel and explore, usually
to places and planets far from their own, and feel a thrill
at experiencing the unfamiliar. Many can instinctively
control and understand technology or speak wirelessly
with technological creatures. Some can create and harness
electricity. To many prismenis, entering the Drift feels like
coming home, and most describe it as tranquil or soothing.
Some prismenis have a connection to the Drift so strong that
their body is sustained or rejuvenated by its energies—the
Drift nourishes their bodies, heals their wounds, protects
them from harm, and settles their ever-racing thoughts.
If you want to play a character who embraces change and
exploration, or who has a connection to the Drift, you should
play a prismeni.

YOU MIGHT...
• Be easily bored by routine, familiar sights and tasks,
and predictable outcomes.
• Love to travel and experience new cultures and
societies.
• Have an instinctive understanding of technology.

OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you know all about the Drift.
• Expect you to worship Triune or be close friends with
a spectra.
• Consider you restless, flighty, or irresponsible.

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Prismenis look similar in appearance to their parents and are
instantly recognizable as a member of their ancestry, yet they
have unique features that set them apart visually from their
peers, such as metallic gray eyes, rainbow-colored locks, thick
cords or wire for hair, or flesh that shimmers with different
colors in various light. Many have technological or electrical
components naturally integrated into their body or can create
and manipulate electricity. While within the Drift, prismenis
“come alive”—their hair, flesh, and eyes become more colorful
and vibrant, their countenance more expressive, and their
actions more confident.

SOCIETY
While all prismenis are drawn inexorably to the Drift, they
rarely stay in one place for long and prefer to remain on the
move, making gatherings of prismenis few and far between.
Sometimes, prismenis incidentally gather at sites important
to spectras or Triune, such as Drift beacons, or at exciting,
once-in-a-lifetime events—such gatherings are often termed
“flashmeets,” though religious prismenis tend to believe
these gatherings are the will of Triune, drawing its disparate
children together in joy or for a shared purpose.
Regardless of their homes or lifestyles, prismenis value
freedom and change. They take joy in discovery and
exploration, both physical and intellectual, and understand
that nothing lasts forever—nor would they want it to.
Most prismenis trust their own feelings and instincts, and
understand when it’s time to leave a relationship, or show
understanding when left in turn. They stagnate under the
yoke of routines and traditions that they can’t escape.
Prismenis hold few naming conventions, selecting names
that speak to them on a personal level rather than cultural.
Most change their name at least twice in their life, once to shed
the name given to them by others for one they feel resonates
better with their identity, and again whenever they believe
they’ve changed, learned a great lesson, or otherwise have
become someone new. They adore nicknames and appellations,
both those given to them by others and chosen for themselves.

BELIEFS
Thanks to their deep spiritual connection to the Drift, the vast
majority of prismenis worship Triune. Those who don’t tend
to be atheists. Prismenis who worship other gods often favor
gods of chaos, change, innovation, or travel, such as Besmara,
Oras, Yaraesa, or Weydan.
Popular Edicts break with tradition, trust your feelings, visit
new places
Popular Anathema allow others to dictate your decisions or
impede your freedom

PRISMENI (HERITAGE)
You have an innate connection to the Drift. You gain the
prismeni trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry.
While in the Drift, you can automatically pinpoint the location
of Drift beacons, Drift drives, Drift engines, and other Drift-
related technology within a 100-mile radius. If you’re Piloting
a starship that doesn’t have a Drift engine, you can serve as
a connection between the Drift and that starship. This is a
1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait, and it allows
the starship you’re Piloting to enter or exit the Drift. Once
within the Drift, the starship travels via conventional thrusters,
as normal. When you get a critical failure on a Piloting check
to Navigate or Plot Course through the Drift, you get a failure
instead. You can choose from prismeni feats and feats from
your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
