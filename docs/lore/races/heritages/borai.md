A borai is simultaneously living and dead—a corpse reanimated by its own soul into something
just barely living. Despite being corporeal undead, a borai’s body is alive, and functions as a
living shell that protects their tattered, undead soul, making them something altogether unique.

YOU MIGHT...
• Be determined to succeed and refuse to accept your
own failure or defeat.
• Embrace new experiences, places, and relationships,
perhaps even recklessly or to your own detriment.
• Fear what killed you or avoid the place you died.

OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Confuse you with a bonetrooper, corpsefolk,
necrovite, or other undead, and become surprised
when you breathe, eat, or sleep.
• Find your presence unnerving, even if they can’t
pinpoint why.
• Seek your advice about grief, loss, death, and the
afterlife.

Borais are most often created by others through a botched resurrection
attempt (whether magical or technological) or necromantic
experimentation, or by oneself through sheer stubborn determination and
refusal to accept one’s demise. Once a person becomes a borai, their living body
and undead soul are inexorably bound to one another. A borai’s body draws
vitality from the soul, preventing external rot and degradation, while the soul
tenaciously clings to their body as a vehicle for corporeality and prolonged life.
Even if a borai is killed and resurrected or reincarnated, this
bond isn’t severed, and a borai always comes back as a borai.
Unlike many forms of undead, borais are the same person they
were before their death—they retain their personality, memories, and
feelings, and often seek to maintain the emotional connections and
relationships they forged in life. Yet, death has left its mark on borais, and
many living beings innately sense something is off about a borai, putting a strain
on a borai’s relationships and other pre-existing social connections. This slow
fracturing of friendships and souring of support systems tends to push borais out
of their comfort zone, driving them from their homes and past lives and toward
the unknown—an experience that leaves many borais jaded, emotionally guarded,
or eager to embrace new experiences.
If you want to play a character who blurs the lines between living and dead, and
who’s struggling to find their place in the universe, you should play a borai.

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Borais appear as they did in life, save that their skin takes on a pallid, waxy
hue, and their blood becomes infused with void energy, turning it into a thick
black ichor that’s clearly visible through their flesh. As their body is alive,
borais must breathe, eat, and sleep, and they can be healed, stabilized, and even
resurrected like any other living creature. Borais age at radically slowed rates,
allowing them to live for a few additional centuries. After this time, a borai’s
physical body deteriorates to such a degree that the soul can no longer sustain
it; the borai then both dies (as living creatures do) and is destroyed (as undead
creatures are). Scholars are divided as to whether these souls move on to their
appointed afterlives or deteriorate and immediately re-enter the cycle of souls as
raw quintessence in Creation’s Forge.

SOCIETY
Borais are reanimated all throughout the galaxy, from the Pact Worlds to the
Vast, making them a diverse people with a scattered population. Most borai are
“born” on Eox or on other planets where necromancy, religious resurrections,
and scientific research into immortality are commonplace. Many borais begin
their second lives trying to live as they did before their death, living the
same lives and maintaining the same routines and relationships—usually
while attempting to hide their undead nature using cosmetics, illusions, or
augmentations. This is frequently doomed to failure, either because those
around them reject their new state, or because the borai feels out of place
and distant from their life. While some borais choose to travel the galaxy, others
migrate to regions more accepting of undead, such as Eox. As borais require the
same comforts as living creatures, they have trouble fitting in, even within undead
societies. A coalition of borais based out of Absalom Station have banded together
to petition the Pact Council for official rights to an asteroid or small moon to create
a home planet, though their requests have yet to bear fruit.
Borais who’ve lived over a decade as undead tend to consider family a matter
of friendship, loyalty, and love rather than a matter of genetics or lineage. Found
families and sprawling friendship groups are common, though some instead find
companionship in mercenary or military units, among members of the same social
movements or religious institution, or within the cutthroat hierarchy of a corporation
or consortium. Some borais embrace their ominous presence and disconcerting
aspects, finding employment as terrifying enforcers or imposing bodyguards, while
others seek to overcome and erase the stigma of their undead nature by holding
diplomatic positions or taking jobs where they interact with the public.
No widespread naming conventions exist for borais, and most retain the name
that they had in life. Some borais who leave behind their old lives adopt new names
of their own creation that they feel better represent their identity heading into the
second (or arguably third) phase of their life.

BELIEFS
Borais are influenced by the cultures and societies they were born into, and many
continue to worship the same gods and cleave to the same philosophies as they
did in life. With time, most borais tend to favor gods of emotion or travel, or who
hold sway over the dead, such as Weydan, Zon-Shelyn, or Urgathoa. Those who
cleave to modern fads and trends, and who manage to keep up with the fast-paced
galactic zeitgeist, instead tend to worship Lambatuin. Many borais take solace
in a philosophy known as the Song of Silence, which teaches that undeath is the
ultimate goal of life, and that one’s mortal life is simply a trial run for one’s undead
life, where one can take the lessons learned through mortality and apply it to their
second life, becoming perfected or enlightened.

BORAI (HERITAGE)
You’ve returned from the brink of death as a borai—at once both living and undead.
You gain the borai and undead trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry.
Unlike other undead, you do not gain void healing. You’re healed by vitality effects
and damaged by void damage, as if you were a living creature. Likewise, you can
be stabilized, healed, and brought back to life as if you were a living creature,
save that you always return to life in your normal undead state (as a borai). You
gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light
vision. You can choose from borai feats and feats from your ancestry whenever
you gain an ancestry feat.
